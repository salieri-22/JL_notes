    \section{Thermochemistry}

    Thermochemistry is a field of study in chemistry where the heat energy is associated with chemical reactions and phase changes. The definition of energy is the capacity to do work.

        comes from the sun and is earth's primary energy source 
        \item[thermal energy]
        is the energy associated with the random motion of atoms and molecules
        \item[chemical energy]

    \subsection{Energy Changes in Chemical Reactions}
    \textbf{Heat} is the transfer of \textit{thermal energy} between two bodies that are at different temperatures. \textit{Temperature} is a measure of thermal energy, not the definition of itself. \\

    The \textit{system} is the specific part of the universe that is of interest in the study.

    \begin{description}
        \item[exothermic process]
        is any process that gives off heat--- transfers thermal energy from the system to the surroundings
        \item[endothermic process] is any process in which heat has to be supplied to the system from the surroundings
    \end{description}

    \subsubsection{Enthalpies of Formation}
    If 1 mol of compound is formed from its constituent elements, then the enthalpy change for the reaction is called the \textbf{enthalpy of formation, $\Delta H^\circ_{f}$}. \\
    \\
    Standard condition/state -  Most stable form of the substance at 1 atm (atmospheric pressure) and 25$^\circ$C (298 K). \\
    \\
    Standard enthalphy, $\Delta H^\circ$, is the enthalpy measured when everything is in its standard state. \\
    \\
    Standard enthalphy of formation - 1 mol of compound is formed from substances in their standard states. These values are found in a data table. If there is more than one state for a substance under standard conditions, the more stable one is used. The value of these stable elements (HOBrFINKL) is zero.

    \begin{equation*}
        \boxed{\Delta H^\circ_{rxn} = \sum n \cdot \Delta H^\circ_{f (products)} - \sum m \cdot \Delta H^\circ_{f (reactants)} }
    \end{equation*}
    \\
    \textbf{Example} Calculate the heat of reaction for the combustion of propane gas giving carbon dioxide and water.

    \begin{center}
        \ce{C3H8_{(g)} + 5 O2_{(g)} -> 3 CO2_{(g)} + 4 H2O_{(g)}}
    \end{center}

    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            \Delta H_{f (products)} &= \ce{3 CO2_{(g)} + 4 H2O_{(g)}} \\
                                    &= 3 \text{ mol} \times \frac{-393.5 \text{ kJ}}{1 \text{ mol}} + 4 \text{ mol} \times \frac{-241.8 \text{ kJ}}{1 \text{ mol}} \\
                                    &= -2147.7 \text{ kJ} \\
            \Delta H_{f (reactants)}&= \ce{C3H8_{(g)} + 5 O2_{(g)}} \\
                                    &= 1 \text{ mol} \times \frac{-103.8 \text{ kJ}}{1 \text{ mol}} \\
                                    &= -103.8 \text{ kJ} \\
            \Delta H_{rxn}          &= -2147.7 \text{ kJ} - (-103.8 \text{ kJ}) \\
                                    &= -2043.9 \text{ kJ} \leftarrow \text{exothermic}
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}

    Note: \ce{H2O} can be liquid or vapour and they have different $\Delta H_{f}$.

    \newpage
    \subsubsection{Hess' Law}

    If a reaction is carried out in a number of steps, $\Delta H$ for the overall reaction is the sum of $\Delta H$ for each individual step. \\
    \\
    Equations can be manipulated to form the overall reaction (multiply by a coefficient, flip the reaction by a negative number). \\
    \\
    \textbf{Example} Determine the heat of reaction for the reaction:
    \begin{center}
        \ce{4 NH3_{(g)} + 5 O2_{(g)} -> 4 NO_{(g)} + 6 H2O_{(g)}}
    \end{center}

    Using the following sets of reactions:
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{l l}
            (1) \ce{N2_{(g)} + O2_{(g)} -> 2 NO_{(g)}}      & $\Delta H$ = 180.6 kJ \\
            (2) \ce{ N2_{(g)} + 3 H2_{(g)} -> 2 NH3_{(g)} } & $\Delta H$ = -91.8 kJ \\
            (3) \ce{ 2 H2_{(g)} + O2_{(g)} -> 2 H2O_{(g)} } & $\Delta H$ = -483.7 kJ \\
        \end{tabular} 
        \break

        Steps to do:      (1) $\rightarrow \times 2$,
                (2) $\rightarrow \times -2$,
                 and (3) $\rightarrow \times 3$

        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Bond Energies}
    Breaking bonds is an endothermic process (positive), while bonds forming is an exothermic process (negative). There is an energy value for a specific bond, usually measured in kJ/mol. The formula to find the heat of reaction is $\Delta H_{rxn} = \text{BB (Bonds Broken)} - \text{BF (Bonds Formed)}$. \\
    \\
    \textbf{Example} Determine the $\Delta H_{rxn}$ using bond energies:

    \begin{center}
        \ce{ 2 C2H6 + 7 O2 -> 4 CO2 + 6 H2) } \\
        \break
        \begin{tabular}{ c | c }
            Bonds Broken & Bonds Formed \\
            2 (1 C-C + 6 C-H) + 7 (O=O)& 4(2 C=O) \\
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    \begin{center}
        Let $\alpha$ = Bonds Broken \\
            $\beta$ = Bonds Formed \\
    \end{center}

    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            \alpha          &= \left(2 \text{ mol} \times \frac{348 \text{ kJ}}{1 \text{ mol}} \right) + \left(12 \text{ mol} \times \frac{413 \text{ kJ}}{1 \text{ mol}}\right) + \left(7 \text{ mol} \times \frac{495 \text{ kJ}}{1 \text{ mol}}\right) \\
                            &= 9117 \text{ kJ} \\
            \beta           &= \left(8 \text{ mol} \times \frac{799 \text{ kJ}}{1 \text{ mol}}\right) + \left(12 \text{ mol} \times \frac{463 \text{ kJ}}{1 \text{ mol}}\right) \\
                            &= 11 948 \text{ kJ} \\
            \Delta H_{rxn}  &= \alpha - \beta \\
                            &= 9117 \text{ kJ} - 11948 \text{ kJ} \\
                            &= -2831 \text{ kJ}

    4. parts per million/billion

    \subsubsection{mass-mass \%}

    \begin{equation*}
        m/m \% = \frac{\text{mass of solute(g)}}{\text{mass of solution (g)}} \times 100 \%
    \end{equation*}

    \textbf{Example} An alloy of 2.7g \emph{gold} jewelry is 83\% pure gold. What mass of gold is in the jewelry?
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            m/m \% &= \frac{\text{mass of solute(g)}}{\text{mass of solution (g)}} \times 100 \% \\
            83 \% &= \frac{x}{2.7\text{g}} \times 100 \% \\
            0.83 &= \frac{x}{2.7\text{g}} \\
            x &= 2.24\text{g}
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}

    \subsubsection{volume-volume \%}

    \begin{equation*}
        v/v \% = \frac{\text{volume of solute (mL)}}{\text{volume of solution (mL)}} \times 100 \%
    \end{equation*}

    \textbf{Example} A 53mL sample of \ce{H2O2} is dissolved in enough water to make 250mL of solution. Determine the v/v \% of \ce{H2O2}.

    \begin{equation*}
        v/v \% = \frac{53\text{mL}}{250\text{mL}} \times 100 \% = 21.2 \%
    \end{equation*}

    \subsubsection{mass-volume \%}

    \begin{equation*}
        m/v \% = \frac{\text{mass of solute (g)}}{\text{volume of solution (mL)}} \times 100 \%
    \end{equation*}

    \textbf{Example} Determine the mass/volume \% of \ce{NaCl} if 30g of salt is dissolved in 500mL of water. Assume no change in volume.

    \begin{equation*}
        m/v \% = \frac{30\text{g}}{500\text{mL}} \times 100 \% = 6 \%
    \end{equation*}

    \subsubsection{parts per million/billion}

    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
        ppm &= \frac{\text{mass of solute (g)}}{\text{mass of solution (g)}} \times 10^6 \\
        ppb &= \frac{\text{mass of solute (g)}}{\text{mass of solution (g)}} \times 10^9
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}

    \textbf{Example} Determine the \emph{ppm} of \ce{Fe^{2+}} if 3.5mg is dissolved in a 100g sample of water.

    \begin{equation*}
        ppm = \frac{0.0035\text{g}}{100\text{g}} \times 10^6 = 35 ppm
    \end{equation*}

    \subsection{Molarity}
    This describes the mols of solute per litre of solution. The unit is mol/L or M.

    \begin{equation*}
        \boxed{M = \frac{n}{V}}
    \end{equation*}

    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{c l}
            $M$ & molarity of the solution \\
            $n$ & number of mols \\
            $V$ & volume (L) \\   
        \end{tabular}

    Dilute a concentrated solution to give one that is less concentrated. (Liquid) \\

    \textbf{Steps: (Solid)} \\
    1. Calculate the mass of solute required. Weigh out sample on a balance. \\
    2. Dissolve solid in some water in a beaker. \\
    3. Transfer to a volumetric flask. \\
    4. Bring to volume with water.\\
    \break
    \textbf{Steps: (Liquid)} \\
    1. Calculate the volume of solute required. Measure using a pipet. \\
    2. Add solute to water in the volumetric flask. \\
    3. Bring to volume with water.

    \subsection{Solubility Rules and Precipitation Reactions}
    Not all ionic compounds dissolve! Instead of doing experiments all the time to see which ones will dissolve, we use the \emph{solubility rules}.

    \subsubsection{General Solubility Rules}
    1. All nitrates (\ce{NO3^{-}}) are \emph{soluble}. \\
    2. All ammomium (\ce{NH4^{+}}) or alkali (\ce{Li^{+}, Na^{+}, K^{+}, Rb^{+}, Cs^{+}, Fr^{+}}) compounds are \emph{soluble}. \\
    3. All carbonates (\ce{CO3^{2-}}), phosphates (\ce{PO4^{3-}}) and hydroxides (\ce{OH^{-}}) are \emph{insoluble} \textbf{except} with the cations in rule 2. \\
    4. All chlorides (\ce{Cl^{-}}), bromides (\ce{Br^{-}}), and iodides (\ce{I^{-}}) are \emph{soluble} \textbf{except} with \ce{Ag^{+}, Pb^{2+}, Hg^{+}}. \\
    5. All sulfates (\ce{SO4^{-2}}) are \emph{soluble} \textbf{except} with \ce{Ca^{2+}, Sr^{2+}, Ba^{2+}, Ra^{2+}, Pb^{2+}}.
    6. All acetates are \emph{soluble} (\ce{CH3COO^{-}, C2H3O2^{-}}).

    \subsubsection{Precipitation Reactions}
    A reaction that produces an insoluble salt is precipitation reaction. The insoluble substance is called a precipitate (ppte). Reactions that form a precipitate have a net ionic equation that shows the ions involved in forming the percipitate. \\

    \textbf{Example} \ce{Na2SO4_{(aq)} + Ca(NO3)2_{(aq)} -> 2 NaNO3_{(aq)} + CaSO4_{(s)}}
    \begin{center}
        \ce{NaNo3} = soluble \\
        $\boxed{\ce{CaSo4} = \text{insoluble}}$
    \end{center}

    \begin{center}
        $\underbrace{\ce{2 Na^{+} + SO4^{-2} + Ca^{+2} + 2 NO3^{-} -> 2 Na^{+} + 2 NO3^{-} + CaSO4_{(s)}}}_\text{Total ionic equation}$
        $\underbrace{\ce{Ca^{+2} + SO4^{-2} -> CaSO4_{(s)}}}_\text{Net ionic equation}$
    \end{center}

    \subsection{Aqueous Reactions and Solution Stoichiometry}
    The majority of work in research and industry involves solutions. Solutions are easy to handle and are usually easier to control in reactions. Solution stoichiometry is the procedure for calculating the molar concentration or volume of solution products or reactants.

    \textbf{Types of Problems} \\
    1. Unknown Volume \\
    2. Unknown Molarity \\
    3. Mass (of precipitate usually) \\

    \textbf{Example} Ammonia and phosphoric acid solutions are used to produce ammonium hydrogen phosphate fertilizer. What volume of 14.8M \ce{NH3_{(aq)}} is needed to react with 1000L of 12.9M of \ce{H3PO4_{(aq)}}?

    \begin{center}
        \ce{2 NH3_{(aq)} + H3PO4_{(aq)} -> (NH4)2HPO4_{(aq)}}
    \end{center}

    \begin{equation*}
        1000 \text{L} \times \frac{12.9 \text{mol}}{1 \text{L}} \times \frac{2 \text{ mol}}{1 \text{ mol}} \div 14.8 \text{ mol/L} = 1740\text{L}
    \end{equation*}

    \subsection{Qualitative Analysis}
    What is qualitative chemical analysis? it is a branch of chemistry that deals with the identification of elmeents or grouping of elements present in a sample. There are usually two types: \emph{qualitative inorganic analysis} and \emph{qualitative organic analysis}.

    \subsubsection{Identifying Ions}
    Chemists often have to determine what substances (ions) are in mixtures with no information. They can use solubility rules (or chart) to determine solubility when solutions contain unknown ions. To create a procedure, we'll need to look at what tests we can do to "figure it out". \\
    \newpage
    \textbf{Flow Chart Example} \\

    $\ce{K^{+}/Ag^{+}} \rightarrow \text{add } \ce{Cl^{-}} \rightarrow \text{ppte} \rightarrow \ce{Ag^{+}} \text{ present, filter it out} \rightarrow \text{flame test} \rightarrow \text{lilac means \ce{K^{+}}} \text{ present} $

    If no ppte, \ce{Ag^{+}} is not present.

    \section{Kinetics and Equilibrium}

    What is chemical kinetics? Kinetics is the study of reaction rates. A rate involves a change in a variable over a change in time.

    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            \text{average rxn rate} &= \frac{\text{change in the number of mols of $\beta$}}{\text{change in time}} \\
                                    &= \frac{\Delta \text{(moles of $\beta$)}}{\Delta T} \\
                                    &= \frac{-\Delta \text{moles of $\alpha$}}{\Delta T}
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}

    How to measure the rate of reaction? Two ways: measure how quickly one of the products is \emph{made}, or measure how quickly one of the reactants \emph{disappears}.

    \textbf{Example} A student reacts Mg with HCl, and obtained the following data about the mass of Mg that reacted.

    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{| r | r |}
            \hline
            Time(s) & Mass(g) \\ \hline
            0 & 1.5 \\
            5 & 1.2 \\
            10 & 0.9 \\
            15 & 0.6 \\
            20 & 0.3 \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    a) Determine the rate of reaction (in g/s) between 10 and 20 seconds. \\
    
    \begin{equation*}
        \text{rate}_{10 \rightarrow 20} = \frac{0.3-0.9}{20-10} = -0.06\textbf{g/s}
    \end{equation*}

    b) Determine the rate of reaction between 0 and 20 seconds in mol/s.

    \begin{equation*}
        \text{rate} = \frac{0.3-1.5}{20-0} = \frac{-1.2}{20} = -0.06\text{g/s} \times \frac{1 \text{ mol}}{24.31\text{g}} = -0.00247 \text{ mol/s}
    \end{equation*}

    \subsection{Instantaneous Rate vs Average Rate of Rxn}
    Instantaneous rate is the rate at that \emph{exact} time (slope of the tangent line). The average rate is $\frac{\Delta \text{quantity}}{\Delta \text{time}} = $ slope. \\

    \textbf{Example} \\
    \begin{center}
        \ce{N2 + 3 H2 -> 2 NH3} \\
        rate of appearance of \ce{NH3} = 2.0 x 10$^{-3}$ M/s \\
    \end{center}

    a) What is the rate of disappearance of \ce{N2}?

    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{aligned}
            \text{rate}_{\ce{ N2}} &= -\left(2.0 \times 10^{-3} \text{ M/s} \times \frac{1 \ce{ N2}}{2 \ce{ NH3}}\right) \\
            &= -1 \times 10^{-3} \text{ M/s \ce{NH3}}
        \end{aligned}
    \end{equation*}

    \subsection{Kinetic Molecular Theory}
    1. All matter is made up of \emph{microscopic-sized particles} (atoms, molecules, ions). \\
    2. These particles are in constant motion because they possess \emph{kinetic energy}. \\
    3. There are spaces between the partciles of matter. The speed and spacing determine the \emph{physical state} of matter. \\
    4. Adding heat increases the speed of the moving particles, thus increasing their kinetic energy as well as the space they occupy.

    \subsection{Collision Theory}
    The collision transfers kinetic enregy needed to break the necessary bonds so that new bonds can be formed.\\
    1. In order for a chemical reaction to take place, the reactants must \emph{collide}. \\
    2. They must have \emph{proper orientation}. \\
    3. Must have enough kinetic enregy to reach a threshold of enregy called \emph{activation energy}. \\
    
    \subsection{Factors Affecting The Rate of Reaction}
    What needs to happen in order for the rate of the chemical reaction to increase (go faster)?

    \begin{center}
        More collisions = Faster reaction rate
    \end{center}

    \begin{description}
        \item[Nature of reactants] how reactive they are; ionic vs. covalent
        \item[Concentrations of reactants] generally speaking, the higher the concentration of reactants, the faster the rate of the reaction
        \item[Temperature] the higher the temperature, the fsater the rate of reaction
        \item[The presence of a catalyst] a catalyst is able to increase the rate of reaction, although the catalyst itself is neither created nor destroyed when performing this function; catalysts don't \emph{cause} a reaction, they just speed it up (lower the activation energy)
        \item[The surface area of the reactants or catalysts] reactions that involve solids often proceed faster if the solid is a fine powder instead of big chunky bits; the physical difference of the two is the surface area
        \item[pressure] gases only; gases tend to expand, making collisions less frequen; increasing pressure (by reducing volume) allows for more collisions to occur
        \item[light] solar energy can act as a catalyst
        \item[agitation] stirring, shaking; allows particles to increase speed and collide with each other        
    \end{description}

    \subsection{Potential Energy Diagrams}

        \caption{Potential Energy Diagrams}
        \end{center}
    \end{figure}

    \begin{description}
        \item[activation energy, $E_{a(forward)}$] the amount of enregy required to reach the transition state or activated complex from the reactants; the reverse is from products to the transition state
        \item[transition state/activated complex] when bonds break and form and reactants become products 
    \end{description}

    \subsection{Reaction Mechanisms}
    The sequence of events that describes the actual process by which reactants become products is called the reaction mechanism. Each of these processes is known as an elementary reaction or process. Molecules, atoms, or ions that are formed during these steps are called reaction intermediates. \\
    \break
    To get the overall balanced equation from a proposed mechanism, you must add the elementary reactions together, then cancel out the species that show up on both sides of the reaction. \\
    \break
    The molecularity refers to the number of reactant particles that are involved in an elementary reaction.
    
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{| l | r |}
            \hline
            Molecularity & Elementary Reaction \\ \hline
            Unimolecular & $\alpha \rightarrow$ products \\
            Bimolecular & $\alpha + \beta \rightarrow$ products \\
            Termolecular & $\alpha + \beta + \lambda \rightarrow$ products \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    The overall reaction speed cannot move faster than the slowest step, known as the rate-determining step.

    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{c c}
            Intermediate & Catalyst \\
            P $\rightarrow$ R & R $\rightarrow$ P
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    \subsection{Rate Laws}
    The rate law expresses the relationship of the rate of rxn to the rate constant and the concentrations of the reactants to some powers.

    \begin{center}
        aA + bB $\rightarrow$ cC + dD \\
        Rate = k[A]$^{x}$[B]$^{y}$ \\
        Rxn is x$^{th}$ order in A \\
        Rxn is y$^{th}$ order in B \\
        Rxn is (x + y)$^{th}$ order overall \\
        \break
        k = rate constant \\
        e.g. k = $\frac{\text{rate}}{[\ce{F2}][\ce{ClO2}]}$
    \end{center}

    \subsection{Chemical Equilibrium}
    Equilibrium reactions are reversible and only happens in a closed system.

    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{gathered}
            K_{c} = \frac{[C]^{c}[D]^{d}}{[A]^{a}[B]^{b}} \\
            K_{c} = \frac{products}{reactants} 
        \end{gathered}

    \subsubsection{Reaction Quotient}

    \begin{equation*}
        Q = \frac{[C]_{i}[D]_{i}}{[A]_{i}[B]_{i}}
    \end{equation*}

    \begin{center}
        Q $<$ K, not enough products (shift right) \\
        Q = K, system is at EQ \\
        Q $>$ K, not enough reactants
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Le Ch\^atelier's Principle}
    If a stress is applied to a system at EQ, the system will change to relieve that stress and re-establish equilibrium. \\

    \textbf{Factors that Affect EQ} \\
    1. Concentration 
    \begin{center}
        Add more reactant $\rightarrow$ Shift right \\
        Remove reactants $\rightarrow$ Shift left \\
        Add more product $\rightarrow$ Shift left \\

    - Consider heat as a \emph{product}
    \begin{center}
        Add heat $\rightarrow$ shift left (K decreases)
        Remove heat $\rightarrow$ shift right (K increases)
    \end{center}
    2.2. Temperature Change: Endothermic Rxn \\
     - Consider heat as a \emph{reactant}
    \begin{center}
        Add heat $\rightarrow$ shift right (K increases) \\
        Remove heat $\rightarrow$ shift left (K decreases)
    \end{center}
    3. Pressure Changes \\
    - Only affects systems with \emph{unequal} moles of gaseous reactants and products.
    \begin{center}
        Increase pressure $\rightarrow$ shifts to the less molecule(s) \\
        Decrease pressure $\rightarrow$ shifts to more molecule(s)
    \end{center}
    4. Presence of a Catalyst \\
    - Only speeds up the rate of reaction \\
    5. Presence of an Inert Substance \\
    - An inert substance is not reactive with any species and will not affect the system

    4. For reactions in acid, add \ce{H2O} to balance O atoms and \ce{H^{+}} to balance H atoms.
    \begin{center}
        \ce{Cr2O7^{2-} -> 2 Cr^{3+} + \textbf{\ce{7 H2O}}} \\
        \ce{\textbf{\ce{14 H^{+}}} + Cr2O7^{2-} -> 2 Cr^{3+} + 7 H2O}
    \end{center}

    5. Add electrons to one side of each half-reaction to balance the charges on the half-reaction.
    \begin{center}
        \ce{Fe^{2+} -> Fe^{3+} + 1 e^{-}} \\
        \ce{\textbf{\ce{6 e^{-}}} + 14 H^{+} + Cr2O7^{2-} -> 2 Cr^{3+} + 7 H2O}
    \end{center}

    6. Use Hess' Law to make a final balanced equation by cancelling out the electrons.
    \begin{center}
        $\boxed{\ce{6 Fe^{2+} + 14 H^{+} + Cr2O7^{-2} -> 2 Cr^{3+} + 7 H2O + 6 Fe^{+3}}}$
    \end{center}

        \item[CATHODE] where reduction occurs (REDCAT)
    \end{description}

    The difference in electrical potential between the anode and cathode is called: \\
    $\rightarrow$ cell voltage \\
    $\rightarrow$ electromotive force (emf) \\
    $\rightarrow$ cell potential

    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{Standard Reduction Potentials}
    Standard reduction potential (E$^\circ$) is the voltage associated with a reduction reaction at an electrode when all solutes are 1 M and all gases are at 1 atm.

    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{gathered}
            \text{Standard emf (E$^\circ$ cell)} \\
            E^\circ_{cell} = E^\circ_{cathode} - E^\circ_{anode}
        \end{gathered}
    \end{equation*}

    The more positive E$^\circ$, the greater the tendency for the substance to be reduced.
