Notes I made during my final year of highschool (J.L. Ilsley High School)

Written in LaTeX

## Topics
* **Chemistry 12** (Solutions, Thermochemistry, Kinetics and Equilibrium, Acids and Bases, and Electrochemistry)
* **Precalculus 12** (Function Transformations, Radical Functions, Polynomial Functions + derivatives, Trigonometry, and Rational Functions) *NOTE:* My notes were supplemented with [Paul Dawkin's Algebra/Trigonometry cheat sheets](http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Extras/CheatSheets_Tables.aspx)
* **AP Calculus AB** (Assignments made in Photoshop, Contextual Applications of Differentiation, Integration and Accumulation of Change, Applications of Integrals) *NOTE:* COVID-19 happened so I was only able to code the aforementioned units and did my assignments via Photoshop
